# why i distanciated myself from LLMs

i’ve always considered myself pro-development. i support new technologies and believe we should embrace innovation with open minds and modern ways of thinking. but there are limits, and one of those, i’ve come to realize, is the overuse of large language models like GPT, Gemini and others.

over the past few months, i’ve intentionally reduced my use of these tools. as someone deeply passionate about language and history, i care about how language evolves, how it's preserved and how it's used in everyday communication. i sense we’re heading in a troubling direction.

the more we rely on AI-generated text, the more we risk losing the personality that human language brings. these models are trained on massive datasets and, by design, tend to produce statistically “average” outputs. that means rare words and playful expressions risk fading away. the very creativity and individuality that make language so human. and in my opinion this is at stake!

worse, this convenience can make us lazy. when everything from emails to essays can be written with a few prompts we stop stretching ourselves. i’ve met people whose projects seem impressive on paper, until you speak to them in person and realize they lack a real understanding of the work. i feel fortunate to have grown up before these tools were widely available. it taught me discipline and the value of learning things the "hard" or curious way.

i’m not against using AI entirely. these tools can be helpful, for several things, even. proof reading, idea generation, quick research... etc. but we need to be thoughtful about how and when we use them. i’ve heard from hiring managers that they no longer read personal letters because they assume they’re all AI-generated. that’s a major loss.

what worries me most is what our written culture might become. news, literature, opinion pieces, all risk being flattened into a uniform language style that lacks depth and character. if we’re not careful we’ll find ourselves in a world where everything sounds the same and no one really knows anything anymore. that’s why i’ve decided to step back. i want to rely on what i know, on the skills i’ve built and on the effort i put in to express myself authentically.

are you creating something or are you outsourcing your thinking? are you learning or just copying? let’s not forget how to write or how to think... or how to be human! :-)
