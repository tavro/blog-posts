# the origin of my names

most people know me as isak — my old name. but recently, i changed it to tyson, because i didn’t feel like isak fit me anymore. part of that had to do with the name’s religious origin, but there are also more to it than that, of course. tyson simply feel closer to who i am right now. 

some people know me as tavro, my online alias. that one is a bit of a puzzle... it comes from my last name, horvath, spelled backwards, with the unpronounceable letters taken out. so: horvath → htavroh → tavro.

and to make things even more compicated, there are the nicknames: isse and tisse. isse came from my ex partner. she just casually called me that on one of our first dates, and it stuck! not just with her, but with my friends too. when i changed my name to tyson, my best friend started calling me tisse — basically isse with a “t” at the front. very creative, in my opinion.

so yeah, i’ve collected a few names over the years. and i’m okay with all of them. whether you call me tyson, isak, tavro, isse or tisse — i won’t take offense. as long as it’s clear you’re talking to me, we’re good. :-)

## meanings

i include this section for those of you who like meanings:

isak /ˈiːˌsak/, in both the bible and the quran, isak (isaac) was the son of abraham and sarah. his name means “one who laughs” because sarah laughed when told she would have a child in her old age.

tyson /ˈtaɪsən/, comes from the old french word "tison", meaning “firebrand”.

horvath /ˈhorvaːt/, means “of croatian origin”, and i got it from my grandfather’s hungarian side of the family. it is spelled horváth in hungary. 

isse /ˈɪsːɛ/, a nickname for isak.

tisse /ˈtɪsːɛ/ – the evolution of isse, post-name-change.
