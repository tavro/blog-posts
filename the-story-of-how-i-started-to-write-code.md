# the story of how i started to write code

it all started with my danish childhood best friend, simon, at the end of 2011. he showed me the [first Minecraft let’s play video i had ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVAcd-ffIMg&list=PLa8bKRZrMSQ6HJvgxPZKXZFIxHpyw5YxP). it was by [Toby Turner (aka Tobuscus)](https://www.youtube.com/user/Tobuscus). that video is what eventually led me to programming.

technically, i had used the software [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) back in 2009. i even found some old Scratch projects of mine recently. but i don’t really count that as “real programming”.

what really got me interested was something simon said: that you could, in theory, create your own mods for Minecraft. he then followed it up with something like, “but that’s way too complicated for you”. challenge accepted!

not long after, i started learning [Java](https://www.java.com/sv/), mostly through YouTube tutorials and a few programming books i managed to get my hands on (from the local library in Alvesta, the city where i grew up). it was a lot of experimenting and trial and error.

later that same year, i made a simple trading mod for Minecraft that let you trade with villagers. i even remember uploading it to [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/). unfortunately, i haven’t been able to find it, if you happen to come across it somehow, please let me know!
