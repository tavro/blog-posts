# one week with glove80

at my office, many people have their own custom developer setups, especially on my team. while looking at my colleagues desks, i noticed that many of us use different kinds of keyboards. among them, there are quite a few split keyboards. so, naturally, i had to look into it as well. after discussing it with some of my co-workers, the person who sits next to me recommended the Glove80, and that’s what i ended up going with.

as some of you already know, i’ve been programming since i was around 11 years old, and since then i’ve always used a “normal” keyboard with a swedish layout. now, i’ve been using the Glove80 for a week, with a completely different layout than i’m used to. so, in this post, i want to share my initial progress.

to practice, i’ve been using [keybr](https://www.keybr.com). over the past week, i’ve spent 5 hours and 11 minutes actively practicing typing. on a regular keyboard, my typing speed is around 80–90 WPM with about 99% accuracy. so far, my highest speed on the Glove80 has been 62.2 WPM, but my current average is 36.3 WPM with an average accuracy of 91.74%. it’ll probably take a while before i’m as effective on the Glove80 as i am on a standard keyboard. but one thing is for sure, my wrists are going to feel a lot better in the long run!

so, what do i think about them? i think it’s still a bit too early to have strong opinions since i’m not fully used to them yet. but overall they feel nice, and they look cool, haha. i really like that i can mount them however i want, and there’s a lot of room for customization, which is awesome. i think the Glove80 has a lot of potential longterm. what’s most important now is that i keep practicing and experimenting to use them efficiently. that said, it still feels super strange to curl your fingers in and out instead of moving your wrists when typing... a more in-depth review will probably come in a few weeks, once i’ve started using them at work for real programming tasks.
