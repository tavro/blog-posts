# salary transparency in tech

inspired by a blog post on salary transparency by an old [friend](https://vladde.net), i have decided to share my own experiences. transparency in salaries is a crucial step towards fairness and equality in the workplace. here is a list of the salaries i have earned as a software developer in my past.

the salaries are presented in swedish kronor (SEK). to approximate the value in american dollars (USD), a simple rule of thumb is to divide by 10.

- **Developer 2025**: 254 SEK/h
- **Developer Intern 2024**: 165 SEK/h
- **Developer Intern 2023**: 156.5 SEK/h
- **Developer Intern 2022**: 156 SEK/h
- **Developer Intern 2021**: 217 SEK/h

> *By open, voluntary transparency we can help to end stigmas around discussing pay and help ensure that the next generations of people in tech are treated fairly.*
