# blog challange

big thanks to [Ava](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/) for inspiring me to write this post! i followed [Kev Quirk’s version](https://kevquirk.com/blog/blog-questions-challenge) of the challenge instead, since i’m not using bear blog.

## why did you start blogging in the first place?

i started blogging as a way to maintain and improve my writing skills. i do it just for fun, there’s no goal of building an audience. but if someone happens to read it, that’s a nice bonus.

## what platform are you using to manage your blog, and why?

it’s a custom setup using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages. i enjoy the flexibility and control it gives me over how things work and look.

## have you blogged on other platforms before?

not that i can remember... but i probably have. if i did, i must have blocked out those memories. and probably for good reason!

## how do you write your posts?

since launching my new website, i’ve been writing posts directly through the GitHub UI in my browser. before that, i had a custom CMS i built myself (adding features as i needed them). but that quickly became time-consuming, which actually kept me from writing. this new approach is simpler, so i prefer it.

## when do you feel most inspired to write?

inspiration usually strikes randomly. sometimes it’s sparked by an interesting idea or concept often triggered by conversations with people around me. other times it comes from something i read online. either way, i write down the idea and try to write a post as soon as i get home.

## do you publish immediately, or let your posts sit in drafts?

i tend to publish right away. ironically, i usually dislike my posts as soon as i hit “publish”. that’s why i try not to overthink it, just post and move on. i’ll often revisit later with a fresh perspective and revise or delete parts that no longer feel right. 

## what’s your favorite post on your blog?

right now it’s "salary-transparency-in-tech.md". i believe in transparency, especially when it can make a real difference. when i initially posted it in 2024, i found out that a female colleague of mine was being paid significantly less than i was. i think the post helped her realize her value, and it may have contributed to her decision to leave the company. i’ve since left too. the whole thing still disgusts me.

## any future plans for your blog?

yes! i’m planning to serve markdown files directly from my GitHub repo styled with a custom theme that matches my site's overall design. on my old blog i had features like comments, likes/dislikes, a subscription option and sharing tools. i’d love to bring some of that back. i just need to figure out the best technical way to implement it, to not make it too complicated (yet again).

# nominations

i do not really have any blogging friends that have not already done this challange before, at least not that i know of. the only one i can think of off the top of your head is vladde https://github.com/vladdeSV. i will contact him and see what he thinks. if he is open to it, i will link his entry here!
